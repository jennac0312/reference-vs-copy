    // start with strings, numbers and booleansn  
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2) // 100, 100
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2) // 200, 100

    let name = "wes"
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2) // "wes" "wes"
    name = "wesley"
    console.log(name, name2) // "wesley" "wes"

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    console.log(players, team) // as expected
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "lux"

    // however what happens when we update that array?
        // updates the original array also! bc team is a reference to the original array. it goes back and modifies the reference.
        //if you update an array it will always update back

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
        // returns entire array, untouched (since we are passing nothing)
    // one way
        // now, modifying team2 does not change the original ray players

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
        // spread operator takes every item out of the iterable and put it into the containing datat type... in this case an array
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99 // modifies person object.. captain is a reference not a copy!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age : 12 } )
    // Object.assign( blank object, object you wish to copy props from, new props you want to overwrite or add )
    console.log(cap2) // number is 99... person doesnt have number prop

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = { ...person } // object spread is not in JS yet :(
    // this is SHALLOW
        // meaning itll only ever go 1 level deep

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wes',
            facebook: 'wesbos.dev'
        }
    }

    console.log(wes)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes )
    dev.name = "wesley"
    console.log(dev) // dev name is wesley, wes name is wes
    //bc we took a copy of the original object. dev is not a reference


    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    console.log(dev.social) // @ coolman
    console.log(wes.social) // also @coolman ...
    
    // why? bc object assign only goes one level deep. online there is a "clone deep funciton"

    //poor mans deep clone lol
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
